# 04_ffmpeg

Background: When I record how-to or "explainer" videos, there are often pauses as I assemble my words (even when I write out scripts ahead of time.)  Manually editing the video to trim out the silences so my sentences flow smoothly is really tedious.  Let's use the [ffmpeg library](https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html) to edit out those selences.

Objective: Use ffmpeg to process video in differeent ways:
- Extract audio from video
- Identify silences in the audio
- Edit the video to trim out the silences
