# 04_ffmpeg

Objective: Process video using the [ffmpeg library](https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html):
- Extract audio from video
- Identify the silences in the audio
- Edit the video to trim out the silences

Background: When I record how-to or "explainer" videos, there are often pauses as I assemble my words (even when I write out scripts ahead of time.)  
Manually editing the video to trim out the silences so my sentences flow smoothly is really tedious.  Let's use the ffmpeg library to edit out those selences.
